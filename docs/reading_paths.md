# Reading Paths

Choose a path that matches your role and time budget.

![Recommended reading paths](assets/diagrams/reading_paths.png)

## Scientist (analysis-first)
- Skim [Concepts](concepts/index.md) to align on cube semantics.
- Run [Getting Started](quickstart.md) and a sample [Recipe](recipes/index.md) for a quick win.
- Dive into [Datasets](datasets/index.md) to pick sources, then consult [Verbs & Examples](capabilities/textbook_verbs.md).

## Developer (extensibility)
- Read [Documentation Overview](overview.md) to map the sections.
- Study [Capabilities](capabilities/index.md) and the [API Reference](api/index.md).
- Check [Public API & scope](project/public_api.md) and [Deprecation inventory](project/deprecation_inventory.md) before contributing.

## Student (learning the model)
- Start at [Home](index.md) and the [Concepts Overview](concepts/index.md).
- Walk through [Getting Started](quickstart.md) and explore the [Cube grammar pipeline](concepts/index.md#cube-grammar-pipeline).
- Compare data options in [Which dataset should I use?](datasets/which_dataset.md) and visualize with [Visualization Overview](viz/index.md).

Use these paths as shortcuts; the sidebar and search remain the fastest way to jump to a specific verb or dataset.
