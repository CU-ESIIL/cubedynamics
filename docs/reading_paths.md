Different readers land in Climate Cube Math with different goals. Choose a path that matches your context and time constraints.

## Path 1: First contact (15 minutes)
- Start with the [Start Here](start_here.md) landing page for the big picture.
- Skim the [Concepts](concepts/index.md) page to see the cube grammar and terminology.
- Run the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to confirm your environment and a minimal verb pipeline.

## Path 2: Building an analysis (1–2 hours)
- Read through [Capabilities](capabilities.md) and the [Verbs & Examples](capabilities/textbook_verbs.md) overview.
- Choose a dataset from [Datasets](datasets/index.md) and note its spatial/temporal semantics.
- Follow a [Recipe](recipes/recipe_template.md) that resembles your workflow, adapting verbs and parameters.

## Path 3: Extending or contributing (half day)
- Review the [Project Scope](project/scope.md) and [Public API](project/public_api.md) boundaries.
- Check the [Contributing](dev/contributing.md) guidelines and [Development](development.md) notes.
- Explore the [API Reference](api/index.md) for implementation details and docstrings.
