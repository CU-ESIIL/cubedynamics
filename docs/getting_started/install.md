# Installation & setup

CubeDynamics (`cubedynamics`) runs anywhere `xarray` does—laptops, clusters, or hosted notebooks. Use this guide to install the package, configure environments, and find ready-to-run notebooks.

## Choose an installation source

### Install from GitHub today

Grab the latest commits straight from `main`. Installing inside a virtual environment (`venv`, Conda, or `uv`) is recommended but optional.

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/climate_cube_math.git@main"
```

### Install from PyPI once released

The first PyPI release will ship as soon as the streaming loaders stabilize. At that point you can simply run:

```bash
pip install cubedynamics
```

Until then, the GitHub install above is the canonical way to pick up fixes and examples.

## Environment notes

- **Python version** – target Python 3.10+ to match the test matrix.
- **xarray + dask** – both dependencies ship automatically; if you already manage these packages with Conda, install CubeDynamics inside that environment to avoid duplication.
- **Optional extras** – notebooks rely on `jupyterlab`/`notebook`, Lexcube visualizations require a live frontend (VS Code, JupyterLab, or Binder).

## First steps after install

1. Launch a notebook (JupyterLab, VS Code, Colab, Binder, etc.).
2. Import the helpers and stream a cube:

   ```python
   import cubedynamics as cd
   from cubedynamics import pipe, verbs as v

   cube = cd.load_prism_cube(
       lat=40.0,
       lon=-105.25,
       start="2000-01-01",
       end="2020-12-31",
       variable="ppt",
   )

   pipe(cube) \
       | v.anomaly(dim="time") \
       | v.month_filter([6, 7, 8]) \
       | v.variance(dim="time")
   ```

3. Continue into the [First PRISM cube guide](../quickstart.md) for more context, AOI patterns, and Lexcube screenshots.

## Documentation + notebooks

- Read [What is a cube?](../concepts/cubes.md) to align vocabulary.
- Study [Pipe syntax & verbs](../concepts/pipe_and_verbs.md) for the `pipe(cube) | verbs` grammar.
- Open the maintained notebooks:
  - [Quickstart – CubeDynamics](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/climate_cube_math/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_cubedynamics.ipynb)
  - [Sentinel-2 NDVI anomaly tutorial](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/climate_cube_math/blob/main/notebooks/example_sentinel2_ndvi_zscore.ipynb)

These notebooks match the code snippets in the documentation, so you can copy/paste cells or launch them on Binder for a fully hosted workflow.
