# Recipes Overview

This section answers: **How do I assemble verbs and datasets into applied workflows?** Use it to find end-to-end guides you can copy, adapt, and extend.

You will find:
- A recipe template for new analyses.
- Example workflows across climate variance, NDVI, and synchrony analyses.
- Pointers to visualization tools that close the loop on interpretation.

## Featured recipes
- [Recipe template](recipe_template.md): scaffolding for your own workflow.
- [gridMET variance cube](gridmet_variance_cube.md): streaming variability analysis over climate grids.
- [PRISM variance cube](prism_variance_cube.md): terrain-aware climate variability using PRISM inputs.
- [Cube math primitives](cube_math_primitives.md): building blocks and patterns.
- [Sentinel-2 NDVI z-score cube](s2_ndvi_zcube.md) and [correlation center](s2_corr_center.md): vegetation condition and synchrony.
- [Tail dependence walkthroughs](s2_tail_dep_center.md, s2_tail_dep_manual.md): advanced distributional patterns.
- [Suitability tubes visualization](../viz/suitability_tubes.md): pair tube discovery with recipe outputs.
