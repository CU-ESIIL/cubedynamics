# Recipes Overview

This section answers: **How do I assemble verbs and datasets into applied workflows?** Use it to find end-to-end guides you can copy, adapt, and extend.

In this section you'll find:
- Featured workflows across climate variance, NDVI, and synchrony analyses.
- How to adapt the recipe template for new analyses.
- Links to visualization tools that close the loop on interpretation.

Key links:
- [Cube math primitives](cube_math_primitives.md)
- [gridMET variance cube](gridmet_variance_cube.md)
- [PRISM variance cube](prism_variance_cube.md)
- [Sentinel-2 NDVI z-score cube](s2_ndvi_zcube.md)
- [Tail dependence walkthrough (center)](s2_tail_dep_center.md)
- Authoring a new recipe? Use the [recipe template](recipe_template.md).
