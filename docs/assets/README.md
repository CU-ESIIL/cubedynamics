# Assets

Place supporting images for the documentation inside this folder.

- Use `docs/assets/diagrams/` for diagrams and schematic figures referenced throughout the docs.
- Use `docs/assets/figures/` for illustrative figures or photos.

Filenames are referenced directly in Markdown pages, so keep names stable when replacing placeholders.

Recommended formats: PNG or SVG for clarity in the MkDocs theme.

Placeholder `.png` stubs live in `docs/assets/diagrams/` and `docs/assets/figures/` for linked images; replace them with final artwork when available.
