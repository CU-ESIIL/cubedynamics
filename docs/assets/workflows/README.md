# Workflow assets

Place workflow-specific diagrams and figures in this directory. The folder keeps recipe walkthroughs and streaming guides from referencing ad-hoc paths elsewhere in the docs tree.

Guidelines:
- Prefer SVG (or other text-based vector) images sized for the documentation layout.
- Use descriptive filenames that match the associated recipe page.
- Keep temporary or placeholder artwork checked in to avoid broken links in strict MkDocs builds.
- A placeholder `fire_event_vase_hull.svg` is provided so the fire-event vase hull recipe renders cleanly until final artwork is
  available, without adding binary assets to the repo.
