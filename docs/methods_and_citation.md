# Methods & Citation

CubeDynamics is grounded in a grammar that makes analytical steps explicit. Each verb corresponds to a documented operation that can be inspected, reproduced, and cited.

## Methods summary
- Pipelines declare operations as verbs chained through `pipe(...)`
- VirtualCubes provide streaming execution for large spatiotemporal domains
- Verbs expose parameters and defaults that are versioned and testable
- Visualization verbs produce provenance-aware plots for quality control
