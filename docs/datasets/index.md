# Datasets Overview

This section answers: **Which datasets can flow through the cube grammar and how do they differ?** Use it to compare coverage, cadence, and variables before committing to a workflow.

In this section you'll find:
- Loader entry points for climate, vegetation, and fire datasets.
- Notes on spatial and temporal semantics that affect alignment.
- Links to compatibility, selection guidance, and citation details.

Key links:
- [Which dataset should I use?](which_dataset.md)
- [Compatibility matrix](compatibility.md)
- [Dataset citations](citations.md)
- [gridMET](gridmet.md)
- [PRISM](prism.md)
- [Sentinel-2 NDVI](sentinel2_ndvi.md)
- [Landsat 8 (MPC)](landsat8_mpc.md)
- [FIRED](fired.md)

## Supported datasets at a glance

- [PRISM](prism.md): Terrain-aware precipitation and temperature with long-term consistency.
- [Sentinel-2 NDVI](sentinel2_ndvi.md): 10 m vegetation condition with 5-day revisit.
- [Landsat 8 (MPC)](landsat8_mpc.md): 30 m surface reflectance streamed from Microsoft Planetary Computer.
- [FIRED](fired.md): Event-level and daily fire perimeters for fire-aware analyses.
