# Datasets Overview

This section answers: **Which datasets can flow through the cube grammar and how do they differ?** Use it to compare coverage, cadence, and variable availability before committing to a workflow.

You will find:
- Loader entry points for climate, vegetation, and fire datasets.
- Notes on spatial/temporal semantics that affect alignment and aggregation.
- Pointers to dataset-specific pages for parameter choices and citations.

## Supported datasets at a glance
- [gridMET](gridmet.md): Daily CONUS meteorology for climate summaries and anomalies.
- [PRISM](prism.md): Terrain-aware precipitation and temperature with long-term consistency.
- [Sentinel-2 NDVI](sentinel2_ndvi.md): 10 m vegetation condition with 5-day revisit.
- [Landsat 8 (MPC)](landsat8_mpc.md): 30 m surface reflectance streamed from Microsoft Planetary Computer.
- [FIRED](fired.md): Event-level and daily fire perimeters for fire-aware analyses.
